# Refactoring-ATM
I did improvements to project ATM

## usage
You can add money and you can withdraw money enter directly the amount or you can use the arrows in the field of text.

## Installation
You don't need anymore than a browser, I will recomend you use Chome to have the best experience.

## Description
I worked with React Web Components, React states, `<select>` , `<option>` and `onChage` elements.
I did Input Validations and canstings for example `Number(event.target.value)`.
The project is to apply Validations, handle React States and understand the components that are going to render in our browsers, in this project I hided elements and avoid that users can't withdraw more money that they can have.
